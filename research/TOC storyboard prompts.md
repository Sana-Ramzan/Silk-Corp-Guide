A storyboard is a visual representation of how a story will play out, scene by scene. It sketches out the look, feel, and movement of a film, video, or animation project. To create a storyboard, you need to follow some styleguides that will help you communicate your vision clearly and effectively. Here are some styleguides that you may find useful:
Choose your aspect ratio. This is the shape of your frame, which depends on the format and platform of your project. For example, a widescreen film may use a 16:9 aspect ratio, while a social media video may use a 1:1 or 9:16 aspect ratio1.
Keep it rough. You donâ€™t need to draw every detail of your scene, just the essential elements that convey the action, emotion, and composition. Use simple shapes, lines, and colors to sketch out your frames. You can also use reference images or photographs to save time and illustrate your ideas12.
Keep it moving. A storyboard should show the flow and rhythm of your story, not just the static shots. Use arrows to indicate the direction and speed of movement, such as camera pans, zooms, tilts, or character motions. You can also use transitions to show how one scene shifts to another, such as cuts, fades, dissolves, or wipes12.
Consider continuity. A storyboard should maintain consistency and logic throughout your story. Make sure that the elements in your frames match the script and the timeline of your story. For example, if your character is wearing a hat in one shot, they should still have it in the next, unless there is a reason for them to lose it. Also, pay attention to the lighting, color, and mood of your scenes, and make sure they match the tone and genre of your project12.
These are some of the basic styleguides for creating a storyboard. You can also find more tips and examples from various sources, such as , , or . I hope this helps you with your storyboard project. ðŸ˜Š
