### My research about types of looms.
 ### Types of Weaving Looms
 Here are some different types of weaving looms.

At the most basic level, looms hold lengthwise threads taut while other threads are woven through them crosswise. There are several types of weaving looms with different features, but at their essence all of them perform this fundamental task. The threads that are held taut on a loom are called the warp, and the threads that cross the warp are called weft.

Once you understand the weaving process, it's easier to recognize the different types of weaving looms, and you'll have an idea of which types of looms are best for you.

### Basics of Weaving and Looms
As they weave, the weaver lifts or lowers some of the warp threads to form an opening between them called a shed. The weaver then pushes the weft through that opening using a tool called a shuttle. Except for the most basic of looms, such as frame looms, all looms have some method for creating sheds. For example, on multi-shaft looms, warp threads are lifted or lowered because they are threaded through heddles that hang on frames called harnesses. When the weaver uses treadles or levers to lift or lower the harnesses, the warp threads threaded through heddles on those harnesses go up or down and create a shed. On simpler looms (inkle looms, backstrap looms, and rigid-heddle looms), the heddles are moved up or down manually to create the shed.

A weft-carrying shuttle can be as simple as a stick wrapped with thread or can be a fairly technical flying shuttle that zooms across the warp with the quick flick of a cord. In either case, as a shuttle moves through the shed across the warp, it leaves a trail of weft. Each pass of a shuttle through the shed is called a pick. After each pick, the weaver changes the shed by changing which warp threads are lifted or lowered and places the pick using a part of the loom called a beater that holds what is called a reed that resembles a very large comb in a frame. Placing a pick is called beating, except for the case of a heavy rug where placing is a better description.



Along with it's role in beating, the reed determines the spacing of the warp threads so that the resulting fabric is evenly woven. Backstrap and inkle looms rely on the natural tendency of threads to move together rather than spacing by a reed, and use the edge of a shuttle to beat. The rigid heddle on a rigid-heddle loom contains the heddles, reed, and beater; it creates the shed, spaces the warp threads, and beats in the weft.

### Types of Looms:
### Backstrap Loom:

The backstrap loom is a simple loom developed by ancient civilizations and still used in many countries today. The warp is tied around a stationary object on one end and to the weaver at the other. The weight of the weaver keeps the warp taut. A skilled weaver can produce beautiful and complex patterns using a backstrap loom.

### Tapestry Looms:

Tapestry looms include the simplest of looms, the frame loom. Frame looms do not have any ability to create a shed, and a tapestry you create on a frame loom is constrained to the size of the frame. Other types of tapestry looms hold longer warps and offer methods of creating a shed.

### Inkle Looms:
Inkle looms are used to weave narrow strips of fabric such as straps and belts. They are portable and while they are a great beginner’s loom, experienced weavers also use them to create complex patterns. The bands can serve as purse straps, dog collars, leashes, and many other items.

### Rigid-Heddle Looms:
 A rigid-heddle loom is a good beginner’s loom. It also offers a lot in terms of patterning to an experienced weaver through hand manipulation of the warp and weft. With one rigid heddle, they can be used for two-shaft weaving using yarns that are generally thicker than those used by multi-shaft looms. By adding another heddle, the weaver can use thinner yarns and weave more intricate patterns using pick-up sticks and hand manipulation techniques. Rigid-heddle looms are portable. They can be used with or without a stand.
 ### what is weaving:  

Weaving is a fascinating textile art and technique where two sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to create fabric or cloth. Here's a breakdown of its key elements:
Threads:
Warp: These are the vertical threads stretched lengthwise on the loom, forming the foundation of the fabric.
Weft: These are the horizontal threads woven back and forth through the warp threads, creating the actual structure of the fabric. 
### Weaving Process:

### The basic weaving process involves three main steps:

Warp Setup: The warp threads are carefully prepared and stretched onto the loom.
Shed Opening: Specific warp threads are raised or lowered using various mechanisms, creating a shed or opening through which the weft thread can pass.
Beating Up: The weft thread is inserted through the shed and pushed tight against the previous weft row using a reed or beater.
Patterns and Designs:

By varying the sequence of how warp and weft threads are interlaced, weavers can create an endless variety of patterns and designs, from simple plain weave to intricate damasks and tapestries. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination and skill of the weaver.
### Types of waves: 
Basic Weaves:

### Plain Weave: 
The simplest and most common weave, resulting in a smooth, flat fabric with a subtle grid-like pattern. Habotai and crepe de chine are classic examples of plain weave silk.
### Twill Weave:
With diagonal lines running across the fabric surface, twill offers a slightly textured look and improved durability. Shantung and faille are popular twill weave silks.
### Satin Weave:
Characterized by a high shine and luxurious drape, satin achieves this by having long floats (threads that skip several warps) on the face side. Charmeuse and satin charmeuse are well-loved satin weave silks.
### Complex Weaves:

### Jacquard Weave:
Utilizes intricately punched cards to control individual warp threads, allowing for incredibly detailed and complex patterns. Brocades and damasks are examples of Jacquard weave silks.
### Warp Print Weave:
Features pre-printed designs on the warp threads, which are then woven into the fabric, creating vibrant and colorful patterns.
### Double Weave:
Two layers of fabric are woven simultaneously, often with different colors or patterns on each side. This creates a thicker, reversible fabric with an interesting textural dimension.
### Specialty Weaves:

### Noil Weave:
Made from the shorter fibers of the silkworm cocoon, noil weave silks have a slubby, textured appearance and a more casual feel.
### Dupioni Weave: 
Featuring uneven threads and slubs throughout the fabric, dupioni silk offers a unique rustic charm and texture.
### Crêpe Weave:
Intentionally woven with twisted yarns, crêpe silk has a naturally wrinkled surface and a soft, fluid drape.


### Tapestry Looms: 
### 
tapestry weaving! A rich tapestry indeed, woven with diverse techniques and styles. Exploring the types of tapestry weaving is like embarking on a journey through artistic history and contemporary innovations. To guide our exploration, let's consider different angles:

### Traditional Techniques:

### Single Weft:
The simplest form, building your image with one weft thread at a time, creating a clean, blocky style.
Two Weft: Introduces subtle shading and blending by using two different weft threads within one row.
Three Weft: Opens up a wider range of color combinations and transitions, ideal for intricate details.
Combined Warp and Weft: Involves using multiple colors in both warp and weft threads, creating complex patterned backgrounds.
Beyond the Basics:

### Soumak: 
Adding dimension and texture through wrapped weft stitches, creating raised areas and contours.
Twining: Interlacing pairs of weft threads, resulting in diagonal patterns and a unique woven structure.
Tapestry Crochet: Combining tapestry principles with crochet techniques, offering flexibility and portability.
Modern Adaptations:

### Abstract Tapestry:
Breaking free from figurative imagery, focusing on shapes, textures, and colors for a non-representational style.
Mixed Media Tapestry: Incorporating non-traditional materials like beads, feathers, or metal threads for a unique sensory experience.
Machine-Made Tapestry: Utilizing specialized weaving machines to achieve intricate designs and larger tapestries.
Additional Considerations:

### Loom Choice: 
High-warp (vertical) or low-warp (horizontal) looms can influence your technique and project size.
Yarn Selection: Wool, cotton, linen, silk, and various blends offer different textures, weights, and color possibilities.
Cartoon Design: A detailed drawing or plan that guides your weaving, ensuring accuracy and composition.
This is just a glimpse into the diverse world of tapestry weaving. Remember, the possibilities are endless! Feel free to ask about specific techniques, historical styles, or contemporary artists who inspire you. Let's unravel the threads of your curiosity and weave a conversation as vibrant and intricate as a tapestry itself.

WEAVING ON THE ELP LOOM
1. Rigid heddle. Move up and down to change position
of length-wise (warp) threads, so you can weave.
2. Back beam or warp beam.
3. Rear ratchet – loosen to move cloth forward. Then
tighten up to weave.
4. Wing nuts. Loosen to fold loom up. Tighten to hold in
position while you weave.
5. Cloth.
6. Front beam.
7. Front ratchet. Wind towards yourself to move the
cloth forward.
8. Cloth beam. As you weave, you will wind cloth onto
this beam to free up more warp threads for your
children to weave.
9. Base.

### THE FUNCTIONS OF TEXTILE WEAVES;
i. Kente textile weave from Ghana have been used for clothe wearing but now serves the
decorative use of wall hanging, bell pulls and sitting room mats.
ii. The Akwetes Kente weaves are used for ceremonial occasions in the past .
iii. The Akwetes textile weaves are worn by women as wrapper skirt with light white blouse on top.
Other uses are in form of suite coats, waist jackets, shoes, headtie, decoration’s tapestry.
Types of Weaving Looms and Their Weaves;
a. The horizontal loom is designed for the men and commonly used in Kano, Bida, Iseyin, Junku
in Senegal, Yola, Okene and Benin. The cloth woven by the Yoruba male weaver on the
horizontal loom is a long continuous strip roll, measuring about 5ins- 6ins in width.
b. The vertical loom is designed for the women and also popular with the Kanuri, Junku, Dakar,
Benin and Yoruba speaking areas of Nigeria. The women cloth of the Yoruba and Akwete
women in a vertical looms has a regular and predictable length.
